# Mission Statement

Team Dingo is dedicated to empowering computer science students by simplifying how they showcase their skills and access career resources, bridging the gap between education and employment.

# Problem Statements

# Problem Statement 1:
Students often struggle to effectively share and showcase their coding work, particularly when it comes to displaying project overviews rather than just the underlying code. Standard solutions like GitHub have been widely adopted in computer science education and offer tools for code documentation, version control, and collaboration. However, they lack options to create polished, professional portfolios that can effectively demonstrate a student's capabilities to potential employers. This creates a significant gap between the academic adoption of GitHub as a primary tool for managing coding assignments and students' need to professionally present their work.
How can we create a way for students to better showcase the coding work they've accomplished in an organized and professional manner, while still integrating with the widespread use of GitHub?

# Problem Statement 2:
Students frequently encounter challenges when transitioning from their undergraduate studies into internships and career opportunities, often struggling to locate relevant positions and access the resources needed to prepare for professional roles. At UMaine, career-related resources and opportunities are scattered across multiple platforms and departments, which leaves students feeling overwhelmed and underprepared as they navigate their transition into the workforce. Although the university does provide some solutions, including career panels, job fairs, and platforms like CareerLink that connect students with potential opportunities, these existing resources don’t properly address the fundamental navigation challenges students face. Not all students are given the opportunity to leverage relevant resources strategically or understand how to connect their academic learning with real-world applications.
How do we bridge the gap between traditional learning paths and the next major step, whether it be an internship, apprenticeship, or job opportunity?
