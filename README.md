# Communication Policies

# Pings:

@username -> okay anytime

@TeamD -> only when you need the attention of all team members

     Eg.  You need team-wide input for a task
          Something needs to be brought to attention like a suprise deadline
          You need anybody to respond ASAP.
     
     !Eg. You need a particular person's attention

@all -> you need all team members attention AND Dr. Greg's.

Response expectations:

Please check-in at 10 AM and 9 PM
     
     If pinged please respond by or at the next check-in
     If not pinged make sure to still glance at the chat

Who should reply?

  1. First, the person pinged

  2. If unclear -> whoever can answer

  3. Team lead steps in if unresolved

If unable to communicate by Discord, Zoom will be used as an alternative. 

# Mission Statement

Team Dingo is dedicated to empowering computer science students by simplifying how they showcase their skills and access career resources, bridging the gap between education and employment.

# Problem Statement

Students often struggle to effectively share and showcase their coding work, particularly when it comes to displaying project overviews rather than just the underlying code. This problem is exacerbated by many employers utilizing generative AI, limiting the number of entry-level job opportunities being offered to junior engineers entering the workforce. If new graduates could demonstrate their ability to effectively use generative AI to boost their productivity and enhance their skillsets, then they might be more likely to be hired into a traditional junior role. Standard solutions like GitHub have been widely adopted in computer science education and offer tools for code documentation, version control, and collaboration. However, they lack options to create polished, professional portfolios that can effectively demonstrate a student's capabilities to potential employers. This creates a significant gap between the academic adoption of GitHub as a primary tool for managing coding assignments and students' need to professionally present their work. In addition, there is currently no standard way to demonstrate a students’ ability to efficiently and effectively use generative AI. How can we create a way for students to better showcase the coding work they've accomplished in an organized and professional manner that also demonstrates generative AI proficiency, while taking into account the massive academic adoption of GitHub?
